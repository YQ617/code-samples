# Hi! Thanks for visiting my github site for Python coding samples.
# I also have works that use R, Tableau, ArcGIS, etc, but I decided not to include them here for now.
# My repository has two branches, one is for data analysis and visualization and the other is for machine learning works.
# PLEASE COPY THE URL LINK TO https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ if you find any notebook not rendering in github.
# I believe you will meet with the above problem when reviewing HW2 and HW4 notebooks in the data analysis branch.
# Thanks again for reviewing my work! Please contact me via yfqin@upenn.edu if you have any questions.
